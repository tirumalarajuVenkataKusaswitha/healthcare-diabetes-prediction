# Healthcare Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is diabetic based on medical and health-related features. Machine learning models are trained on structured healthcare data to assist in early diagnosis and decision-making.

##  Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early detection to prevent severe complications. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on clinical parameters.

## ️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Workflow
1. Data Loading & Understanding  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Scaling  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation  

##  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (if used)
- Support Vector Machine (if used)

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

##  Results
The trained models successfully classify diabetic patients with good accuracy and balanced precision-recall performance.

##  Dataset
Healthcare diabetes dataset containing patient medical attributes.
